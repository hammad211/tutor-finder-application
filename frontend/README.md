## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **State Management**: Context API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Styling**: Bootstrap (for responsive UI)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io (via backend)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the frontend locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-tutor.git
    cd frontend-tutor
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure it as follows:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://****  # URL for the backend API
    REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://****  # URL for the Socket.io server
    ```

    > Make sure to replace the URLs with the appropriate endpoints if you're deploying the app.

---

## Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api`).
- `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`: The URL for the Socket.io server (usually the same as the backend server).

## Main Features

- **Authentication**: User login and registration using JWT tokens.
- **Real-time Communication**: Real-time chat functionality with Socket.io for live messaging between tutors and students.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI built with Bootstrap.
- **Context API**: Used for global state management (authentication, user data, etc.).
- **Routing**: React Router is used for navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Login).

---

## Usage

To start the frontend locally:

1. **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is taken).

2. **Login/Registration**:

    - You can register a new user on the **Login** page by providing a username, email, and password.
    - After successful login, you’ll be redirected to the **Dashboard** page.

3. **Real-time Chat**:

    - The **Dashboard** page enables real-time chat between users. Messages are sent and received via **Socket.io**.

### Notes

- Ensure that your backend is running before starting the frontend app, as the frontend communicates with the backend API.
- You can deploy the frontend using platforms like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or any static site hosting service.
- If you're planning to use **Socket.io** in a production environment, make sure to set up a secure connection (e.g., `https://`).
